#### Q. What is defensive security?
Ans: The team which takes part in securing, by Detecting Intrusions when they occur and respond, and Preventing Intrusions. Also known as the **Blue Team**

#### Areas of Defensive Security
- Security Operations Center (SOC), where we cover Threat Intelligence
- Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), where we also cover Malware Analysis

## Security Operations Center - works on Threat Intelligence
A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a team of cyber security professionals that monitors the network and its systems to detect malicious cyber security events

#### Threat Intelligence

A threat is any action that can disrupt or adversely affect a system. Threat intelligence collects information to help the company better prepare against potential adversaries
Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

## Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR)

This section is about Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR):

- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Malware Analysis

**Digital Forensics** shifts to analyzing evidence of an attack and its perpetrators and other areas such as intellectual property theft, 
cyber espionage, and possession of unauthorized content

**Incident response** specifies the methodology that should be followed on a cyber attack or data breach.
There are 4 phases of incident response:
1. Preparation
2. Detection and analysis
3. Containment, Eradication and Recovery
4. Post Incident Activity

**Malware Analysis**
Malware analysis aims to learn about such malicious programs using various means:

- _Static analysis_ works by inspecting the malicious program without running it. 
- _Dynamic analysis_ works by running the malware in a controlled environment and monitoring its activities. It lets us observe how the malware behaves when running.
